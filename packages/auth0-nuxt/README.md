## Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDK

```shell
npm i @auth0/auth0-nuxt
```

This library requires Node.js 20 LTS and newer LTS versions.

### 2. Register the Auth0 Nuxt Module

The Auth0 Nuxt module is registered in the `nuxt.config.js` file, together with the runtime configuration. 

```js
{
  modules: ['@auth0/auth0-nuxt'],
  runtimeConfig: {
    auth0: {
      domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_DOMAIN environment variable
      clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID environment variable
      clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable
      sessionSecret: '<SESSION_SECRET>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_SESSION_SECRET environment variable
      appBaseUrl: '<APP_BASE_URL>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_APP_BASE_URL environment variable
    },
  },
}
```

The `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` can be obtained from the Auth0 Dashboard once you've created an application. This application must be a Regular Web Application.

The `SESSION_SECRET` is the key used to encrypt the session cookie. You can generate a secret using openssl:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 64
```

The `APP_BASE_URL` is the URL that your application is running on. When developing locally, this is most commonly http://localhost:3000.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the following URLs in your Auth0 Application via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com):
>
> - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**
> - Add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of **Allowed Logout URLs**

#### Routes

The SDK for Nuxt Web Applications mounts 4 main routes:

1. `/auth/login`: the login route that the user will be redirected to to initiate an authentication transaction. Supports adding a `returnTo` querystring parameter to return to a specific URL after login.
2. `/auth/logout`: the logout route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Logout URLs
3. `/auth/callback`: the callback route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs
4. `/auth/backchannel-logout`: the route that will receive a `logout_token` when a configured [Back-Channel Logout](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout) initiator occurs


To disable this behavior, you can set the `mountRoutes` option to `false` when registering the module (it's true by default):

```ts
modules: [['@auth0/auth0-nuxt', { mountRoutes: false }]]
```

Alternatively, if you wish to change the endpoint paths used for mounting, you can specify the `routes` option:

```ts
modules: [['@auth0/auth0-nuxt', { 
  routes: { 
    login: '/custom-auth/login',
    logout: '/custom-auth/logout',
    callback: '/custom-auth/callback',
    backchannelLogout: '/custom-auth/backchannel-logout',
  }
}]]
```

### 3. Adding Login and Logout

When using the built-in mounted routes, the user can be redirected to `/auth/login` to initiate the login flow and `/auth/logout` to log out.

```html
<a href="/auth/logout">Log out</a>
<a href="/auth/login">Log in</a>
```

When needed, you can also pass a `returnTo` querystring parameter to the login route to redirect the user back to a specific URL after login was successful.

When not using the built-in routes, you want to call the SDK's `startInteractiveLogin()`, `completeInteractiveLogin()` and `logout()` methods through the `useAuth0()` composable, which is available in the server-side context of your Nuxt application.:

```ts
// server/routes/auth/login.js
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const auth0Client = useAuth0(event);
  const authorizationUrl = await auth0Client.startInteractiveLogin(
    {
      authorizationParams: {
        // Custom URL to redirect back to after login to handle the callback.
        // Make sure to configure the URL in the Auth0 Dashboard as an Allowed Callback URL.
        redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/callback',
      }
    }
  );

  sendRedirect(event, authorizationUrl.href);
});

// server/routes/auth/callback.js
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const auth0Client = useAuth0(event);
  await auth0Client.completeInteractiveLogin(
    new URL(event.node.req.url as string, 'http://localhost:3000')
  );

  sendRedirect(event, 'https://localhost:3000');
});

// server/routes/auth/logout.js
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const auth0Client = useAuth0(event);
  const returnTo = 'https://localhost:3000';
  const logoutUrl = await auth0Client.logout(
    { returnTo: returnTo.toString() }
  );

  sendRedirect(event, logoutUrl.href);
});
```

With those in place, you will be able to call `auth/login` and `auth/logout` to log the user in and out of your application.


### 4. Protecting Routes

#### 4.1 Route Middlware

In order to protect a Nuxt route, you can use the SDK's `useUser()` composable method in a custom route middleware. This will check if there is a user and redirect them to the login page if not:

```ts
// middleware/auth.ts
import { useUser } from '@auth0/auth0-nuxt';

export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  const session = useUser();

  if (!session.value) {
    return navigateTo(`/auth/login?returnTo=${to.path}`);
  }
});
```

> [!INFORMATION]  
> You can replace the check above with any check you want, such as checking for a specific user claim.

With that middleware in place, you can protect routes by adding it to the `middleware` property of the corresponding Nuxt route:

```html
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: [ 'auth' ],
});
</script>
```

#### 4.2 Server Middleware
Additionally, you can also use a server middleware to protect server-side rendered routes by using the `useAuth0` server-side composable. This middleware will check if the user is authenticated and redirect them to the login page if they are not:

```ts
// server/middleware/auth.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const url = getRequestURL(event);

  if (url.pathname === '/private') {
    const auth0Client = useAuth0(event);
    const session = await auth0Client.getSession();
    if (!session) {
      return sendRedirect(event, `/auth/login?returnTo=${url.pathname}`);
    }
  }
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The above examples are both to protect routes by the means of a session, and not API routes using a bearer token. 


### 5. Requesting an Access Token to call an API

If you need to call an API on behalf of the user, you want to specify the `audience` parameter when registering the plugin. This will make the SDK request an access token for the specified audience when the user logs in.

```ts
runtimeConfig: {
  auth0: {
    domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_DOMAIN environment variable
    clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID environment variable
    clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable
    sessionSecret: '<SESSION_SECRET>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_SESSION_SECRET environment variable
    appBaseUrl: '<APP_BASE_URL>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_APP_BASE_URL environment variable
    audience: '<AUTH0_AUDIENCE>', // is overridden by NUXT_AUTH0_AUDIENCE environment variable
  },
}
```
The `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is the identifier of the API you want to call. You can find this in the API section of the Auth0 dashboard.

Retrieving the token can be achieved by using `getAccessToken` using the server-side composable `useAuth0`:

```ts
const auth0Client = useAuth0(event);
const accessTokenResult = await auth0Client.getAccessToken();
console.log(accessTokenResult.accessToken);
```
